### ✅ Classifying Recursive and DP Approaches

It's important to understand that the classification depends on the **nature of the problem**, not just the method used. Here's a clean summary:

---

| Scenario                            | Classification         |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| ✅ Recursive with **no overlap**    | **Divide and Conquer**  |
| ✅ Recursive with **overlap + memo**| **Dynamic Programming** (Top-Down) |
| ✅ Tabular (iterative solution)     | **Dynamic Programming** (Bottom-Up) |

---

### 🔁 Key Ideas

- **Divide and Conquer (D&C)**:
  - Breaks a problem into **independent** subproblems.
  - Solves each subproblem recursively.
  - Combines results.
  - ❌ Does *not* reuse or cache subproblem results.
  - **Examples**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
  - Solves problems with **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.
  - Uses:
    - **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Recursive with caching.
    - **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Iterative with a table.
  - ✅ Avoids redundant computation.
  - **Examples**: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

### 📌 Conclusion

> The distinction between D&C and DP lies in whether **subproblems overlap** and **are reused**, not just in whether recursion or tables are used.
